            One of my favourite pieces, Vetements' AW19 University Bomber (commonly referred to as the "fraternity bomber") is a rare and unique piece released during the Autumn-Winter show in 2019 while Demna was still a part of Vetements. To make this piece even cooler, it was a collaboration with Vetements and Alpha Industries, a long-standing and famous company most known for their quality bomber jackets. Some of the things that I find amazing about this jacket is the detatchable hood, with a unique subtext underneath the signature Vetements embroidery, instead of showing the release of the piece, it reads "UNIVERSITY EDITION" to play into the theme of this jacket even more. As much as I love the jacket, sometimes I don't want to show off at all, which is why it's amazing that this jacket is fully-reverseable, with a black-ish and blank exterior. It fits very oversized which is why I went with a Size S.
